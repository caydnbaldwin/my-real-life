## Documentation Hierarchy and Reading Order

### üéØ **Primary Workflow (Start Here)**
1. **Always read this file first** (AI_ALL_IN_ONE.MD) - Contains master index and reading strategies
2. **Complete Context Restoration** - Follow the Session Initialization Protocol below  
3. **Use Task-Based Reading Strategy** - Load only the documentation needed for your specific task
4. **Apply Progressive Knowledge Loading** - Scale reading time from 5min to 60min based on complexity
5. **Self-Validate Before Submission** - Complete AI Agent Checklist in AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.MD

### üìö **Reading Strategy Override**
**Important:** The Task-Based Reading Strategy below takes precedence over any "read all files" instructions. Only read additional files as determined by your specific task complexity and the Progressive Knowledge Loading levels.

## AI Agent Context Restoration

When starting a new session, follow this context restoration process:

### üîÑ **Session Initialization Protocol**
1. **Read this master file first** (AI_ALL_IN_ONE.MD) to understand the current documentation structure
2. **Check project current state** - Review recent commits, active branches, and development phase
3. **Assess task complexity** - Use the Task-Based Reading Strategy below to load relevant documentation
4. **Validate understanding** - Confirm comprehension of requirements before proceeding with implementation
5. **Establish context anchors** - Note key decisions, patterns, and constraints from previous sessions

### üìã **Context Restoration Checklist**
Before beginning any development work:
- [ ] **Project Phase:** Identify current phase (setup/active development/maintenance/refactoring)
- [ ] **Active Branch:** Note current branch and any feature work in progress  
- [ ] **Last Completed Task:** Review recent commits and changes to understand context
- [ ] **Technology Stack:** Confirm current versions (Next.js 15.4.5, React 19.1.0, TypeScript, Supabase)
- [ ] **Key Constraints:** Identify any architectural decisions or patterns already established
- [ ] **Environment Status:** Verify which environment context is relevant (local/staging/production)

## Task-Based Reading Strategy

Optimize documentation reading based on task type and complexity:

### üéØ **Smart Reading Strategy by Task Type**

#### **üÜï New Feature Implementation** 
1. **AI_PROJECT_SETUP.MD** - Confirm technology stack and dependencies
2. **AI_CODING_STANDARDS.MD** - Review SOLID principles and code quality requirements
3. **AI_TESTING.MD** - Understand TDD approach and testing requirements
4. **AI_FILESYSTEM.MD** - Determine correct file placement using decision tree
5. **AI_FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT.MD** - Follow complete feature development workflow
6. **Task-specific files** - Load additional files based on feature requirements

#### **üèóÔ∏è Refactoring / Architecture Changes**
1. **AI_ARCHITECTURE.MD** - Review system design patterns and architectural decisions
2. **AI_CODING_STANDARDS.MD** - Ensure SOLID principles compliance
3. **AI_TESTING.MD** - Plan testing strategy for refactored code
4. **Affected domain files** - Review all files related to the refactoring scope

### üß† **Progressive Knowledge Loading**
Load documentation incrementally based on task complexity:

**Level 1 (Quick Tasks - 5 min):** AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.MD
**Level 2 (Standard Tasks - 15 min):** + AI_PROJECT_SETUP.MD + AI_CODING_STANDARDS.MD
