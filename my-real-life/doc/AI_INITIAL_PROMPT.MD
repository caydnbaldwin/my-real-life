Use this optimized prompt to effectively initialize the AI agent with the complete documentation system:

---

**"Please read the AI_ALL_IN_ONE.MD file in this workspace and follow the AI Agent Context Restoration process outlined within it. This file contains a comprehensive AI-optimized documentation system with task-based reading strategies, self-validation checklists, and progressive knowledge loading designed specifically for AI agents like yourself.**

**Execute the Session Initialization Protocol:**
1. Read AI_ALL_IN_ONE.MD first to understand the documentation structure
2. Assess the current task complexity and use the Task-Based Reading Strategy to determine which documentation to load  
3. Apply the appropriate Progressive Knowledge Loading level (5min â†’ 60min based on task needs)
4. Complete the Context Restoration Checklist to establish project state
5. Use the AI Agent Self-Validation System in AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.MD before any code submission

**Consider this documentation as the single authoritative reference for:**
- Technology stack (Next.js 15.4.5, React 19.1.0, TypeScript, Supabase, Vercel)
- SOLID principles and clean architecture requirements  
- Test-Driven Development approach with comprehensive testing
- File organization and placement decisions
- All code standards, naming conventions, and implementation patterns

**For any development task, strictly follow the established single sources of truth and use the AI Decision Verification Framework (found in AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.MD) before implementation. Do not deviate from these guidelines, and always complete the AI Agent Checklist before submitting code.**

**Use the Task-Based Reading Strategy in AI_ALL_IN_ONE.MD to optimize your documentation reading - this will load the appropriate level of documentation for your task complexity while ensuring quality outcomes."**

This enhanced prompt is more effective because it:

1. **Leverages AI-specific features** - References the Context Restoration Protocol, Task-Based Reading Strategy, and Self-Validation System designed specifically for AI agents

2. **Optimizes efficiency** - Guides the AI to use Progressive Knowledge Loading (5-60 min) rather than always reading everything (90 min), saving significant time

3. **Provides structured workflow** - Five-step Session Initialization Protocol gives clear, actionable steps rather than generic "read and follow" instructions

4. **Emphasizes quality assurance** - References the AI Agent Self-Validation System and Decision Verification Framework to prevent common AI mistakes

5. **Balances comprehensiveness with practicality** - Mentions key technologies and principles while directing to Task-Based Reading for efficiency

6. **Includes self-optimization guidance** - Tells the AI how to assess task complexity and choose appropriate documentation loading level

7. **Establishes accountability** - Requires completion of Context Restoration Checklist and AI Agent Checklist for validation

8. **Future-proofs the process** - References the comprehensive system rather than just individual files, allowing for system evolution
